========================================

I’ve had lots of fun with java in the last 24 hours … The only game that I play every once in a while is minecraft, and I only play that game because it allows for some programming involved … I found a java code manipulator to add commands to the game depending on what the code says, so I’ve been manipulating the files and adding commands that I can execute in game. Super fun, I’ve enjoyed it too much …
